** HOW TO RUN **
- e2e-rag-using-bedrock-kb-cfn (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-rag-solution-using-knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock-and-aws-cloudformation/)
  * Go to London (eu-west-2)
  * Deploy Lambda powertool layer Additional lambda layer: https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/eu-west-1/057560766410/aws-lambda-powertools-python-layer
  * Run sh deploy.sh
  * Create bucket `input-e2e-rag`
  * Create stack using AWS console with these values:
    - Template: https://e2e-rag-deployment-611215368770-eu-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/templates/main-template-out.yml
    - Stack name: e2e-rag
    - Bucket name: input-e2e-rag
  * Once stack is created, upload PDFs to `input-e2e-rag` bucket
  * Synchronize the Knowledge Base's data source
  * Test the Knowledge Base by asking some questions

  * To generate responses it seems only works with Claude 3 Sonnet (https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1c4lbko/testing_knowledge_base_in_amazon_bedrock_does_not/)

- contextual-chatbot-using-knowledgebase (https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/rag-solutions/contextual-chatbot-using-knowledgebase)
  * Create `lambdalayer` folder in `input-e2e-rag` bucket
  * Upload `knowledgebase_lambdalayer.zip` in bucket
  * Create stack from rag-solutions/contextual-chatbot-using-knowledgebase/cfn/DeployKnowledgeBase.yaml
    - Stack name: e2e-rag-lambda
    - Knowledge Base ID: FWA5YOA31J
    - Lambda layer bucket name: input-e2e-rag

  * Run streamlit application
    python3 -m streamlit run chatbot.py
  * Ask questions
